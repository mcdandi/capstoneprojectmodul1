Purwadhika Job Connector - Data Science & Machine Learning Online Program

As part of my journey in the Data Science & Machine Learning program at Purwadhika, I developed a dynamic Employee Data Management System, a mini-application designed to handle comprehensive employee records efficiently. This project showcases full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities with intuitive, user-friendly features. Below are the core components:

1. Employee Management Dashboard
- View All Employees: Displays the complete list of employees with relevant details.
- Search Specific Employee: Facilitates easy retrieval of employee records through keyword search or specific criteria.
- Sort Employees: Allows users to organize employee data by various attributes such as name, department, or ID, enhancing data accessibility and organization.

2. Add New Employee
- A seamless process for adding new employees to the system by entering essential information, such as name, position, and department. The feature ensures accurate data input for efficient onboarding.

3. Update Employee Information
- This feature enables the modification of existing employee details. Additionally, I incorporated an advanced email generation tool, offering two options: auto-generate an email based on the employee's name or manually input a customized email, ensuring flexibility and adherence to company email formats.

4. Delete Employee Records
- A secure function that allows the removal of employee records from the system with the assurance of data integrity and the option to confirm before permanently deleting.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in building robust applications using key programming techniques like data validation, loops, conditionals, and custom functions. The system is designed to be highly practical for real-world employee management, combining functionality with ease of use.
